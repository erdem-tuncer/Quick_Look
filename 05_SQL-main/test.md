To view the data type of a column in a table in SQL Server, you can use the following syntax:

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE  <br> 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS  <br> 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'table_name';  <br> 

This will return a list of columns and their data types for the specified table. For example, if you have a table named "students" and you want to view the data types of its columns, you can use the following statement:

SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE <br> 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS <br> 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'students'; <br> 

This will return a result set like the following:

COLUMN_NAME     DATA_TYPE  <br> 
-------------   ---------- <br> 
id              int          <br> 
name            varchar        <br> 
birthdate       date           <br> 

Note that this will only work if you have access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views in SQL Server. If you do not have access to these views, you can use the following alternative syntax:

SELECT name, system_type_name      <br> 
FROM sys.columns                   <br> 
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('table_name');     <br> 

This will return the same information as the previous query, but it uses system catalog views instead of INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. You can use this syntax if you do not have access to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.

To change the data type of a column in a table in SQL Server, you can use the following syntax:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name new_data_type;

For example, if you have a table named "students" with a column named "birthdate" that is currently of data type DATE, and you want to change it to DATETIME, you can use the following statement:

ALTER TABLE students
ALTER COLUMN birthdate DATETIME;

Note that when you change the data type of a column, you should be careful to ensure that the new data type is compatible with the existing data in the column. If the new data type is not compatible with the existing data, you may have to update or convert the data before you can change the data type.
